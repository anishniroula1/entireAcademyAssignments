| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Remaining cash    | 21,000     |
| Investment return | 8%         |

## Scenario 2: 10% Down Payment

| Description           | Amount ($)   |
| --------------------- | ------------ |
| Home Price            | 420,000      |
| Down Payment (10%)    | 42,000       |
| VA Funding Fee (1.25%)| 4,725        |
| Loan Amount           | 382,725      |
| Interest Rate         | 5.75%        |
| Property Tax          | 4,000        |
| Home Insurance        | 1,200        |

Using a mortgage calculator, we find the following payments (principal and interest) for 30 years:

| Scenario | Monthly Payment | Total Payments |
| -------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| 1        | 2,358.93        | 848,214.12     |
| 2        | 2,230.40        | 802,944.08     |

**Total Cost (including taxes, insurance, and VA Funding Fee) after 30 years:**

| Scenario | Total Cost ($)   |
| -------- | ---------------  |
| 1        | 948,214.12       |
| 2        | 901,944.08       |

**Investment Growth after 30 years (assuming 8% return annually):**

| Scenario | Future Value ($) |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| 1        | 210,731.51       |
| 2        | N/A              |

**Difference in Total Cost and Investment Growth:**

| Scenario | Difference ($)  |
| -------- | --------------- |
| 1        | 737,482.61      |
| 2        | 901,944.08      |

In this case, Scenario 1 (5% down payment) seems to be the better option as you will end up paying less over the course of 30 years after considering the investment growth. However, this is based on the assumption that your investment will consistently yield an 8% return each year. It's essential to keep in mind that investments are subject to market risks and returns may vary.
